										<h4>Which among the philosophical perspective do you think you can connect yourself with? Explain based on the topics discussed.</h4>
										<h6></h6>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">The phrase “Know thyself” from Socrates connects to me most than others. According to Socrates, when an individual knows thyself, all the basic issues and difficulties in life will vanish and everything will be clearer. In my understanding, we need to examine how we operate, like our strengths, limits, what keeps us going, and things that we are ignorant of and why. In this constantly changing world, having a deep understanding of ourselves, will help us to make better or have a clearer decision-making process since there is less self-doubt.</p>

									<h4>Among the sociological perspective discussed, choose one that you can relate yourself more. Explain how this particular perspective connects with you</h4>
									<p style="font-size: larger; color: #f2f2f2;">George Meads’ theory of the social self, which indicates that the ‘self’ is developed through social interactions is the perspective that connects with me most. I liked his view, that when we are young we tend to imitate what our parents, or the people who were close to us, because when you think of it it’s more often than not, true. The phrase “Tell me who your friends are, and I will tell you who you are" makes sense if you look at it this way, since our traits or personality may have been shaped or altered through the influence of the ones we interact with every day. Sometimes our choices or the way we act is because of the so called ‘norm’, we are afraid to express ourselves truly since others may not be widely accepting to our point of view.</p>

										<h4>In your understanding, how does a particular culture affect or shape one’s identity? Explain your answers clearly and give examples</h4>
										<h6></h6>
										<p style="font-size: larger; color: #414141;">I do think that culture affects or shapes one’s identity, for example we Filipino’s are know to be respectful to elders since at a very young age we are always instructed to say ‘po’ or ‘opo’ at the end of our sentences when speaking to elders, and we are known also for our hospitality, sometimes when we eat, and a familiar face appears, we will asked them if they ate too, and will try to offer them to eat or share our meal to them even if we do not have enough. Culture affects the way we live, behave and relate to others, there is a term ‘Culture Shock’ that we feel we are confused about experiencing other people’s culture because we aren’t used to their way of life so we bewildered as we try to adapt. Culture really does shape our identity and affects how we relate to others.</p>
